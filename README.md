# Junk Miner
This is the first game from Smart Jellyfish Games

# Intro
You are a small time space miner piloting a hunk of junk which has failed every interplanetary MOT since you bought it. Either by pure luck, divine intervention or probably because Satan doesn't want you in Hell. Either way  it seems to get you from planet to planet and it's weapons systems are capable of destroying asteroids and mining their ore. 

Expand your ship buy bigger missiles, more powerful lasers and become the top interplanetary junk miner â€“ or at least just get enough money to fix that knocking sound when you get it into second gear.
